### Project Management:  

The project involved the creation of a website for a pressure washing business, with the primary goals of showcasing services, attracting customers, and providing essential information. As my first web development project, it spanned approximately two months. Initially, I embarked on the project with limited planning, taking on challenges as they arose. At each stage of development, I outlined tasks and objectives based on the specific requirements and goals reached during the project. This approach allowed me to maintain flexibility while staying focused on the end result.

### Design and User Experience(UX):

In the development of the pressure washing website, I adhered to modern design practices, focusing on creating an engaging and user-friendly experience for visitors.The chosen color scheme for the website was predominantly blue, as it conveys trust, professionalism, and cleanliness—a perfect fit for the pressure washing industry. or typography, I opted for the Roboto font family. Roboto is known for its readability and versatility, making it an excellent choice for web content. It enhances the overall readability and aesthetics of the website. To ensure an optimal user experience across various devices, I implemented responsive design principles. This approach guarantees that the website remains visually appealing and functional on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.The website's navigation and layout were carefully designed with user-friendliness in mind. Clear and intuitive navigation menus make it easy for visitors to access information about services, contact details, and more.I prioritized clean and organized content presentation. Information about the pressure washing services, including descriptions and pricing, was presented in a clear and concise manner to provide visitors with a quick understanding of what the business offers.To enhance the visual appeal, I incorporated relevant images and graphics related to the pressure washing industry. High-quality images showcasing the before-and-after effects of pressure washing services were included to highlight the business's capabilities. Strategically placed call-to-action buttons encouraged visitors to take desired actions, such as requesting a quote or contacting the business for service inquiries. These CTAs were designed to drive engagement and conversion. Performance optimization was a key consideration. By implementing techniques such as image compression and minification of CSS and JavaScript, I ensured fast loading times, contributing to a positive user experience.

### Content Creation and Management:

During the development of the pressure washing website, I actively engaged in content creation and management. To ensure a cohesive and professional look, I carefully modeled the content formation based on similar websites in the industry. Additionally, I curated and integrated various free images that complemented the website's style and enhanced its visual appeal. This hands-on experience with content creation and management allowed me to craft a compelling online presence for the pressure washing business.

### Team collaboration:

Throughout the development of the pressure washing website, I had valuable experiences in team collaboration. Directly, I collaborated with a computer science student to address a CSS reveal-on-scroll issue. We leveraged GitHub for collaborative version control, forking project branches, and merging changes back into the main branch. Additionally, I received constructive feedback on code indentation, enhancing the overall code quality.
Indirectly, I benefited from the advice and guidance of a senior JavaScript developer. This interaction influenced my approach to working on the backend, managing website hosting, and solving complex problems. Their insights and expertise significantly contributed to the project's success and enriched my learning journey.
